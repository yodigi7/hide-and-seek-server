# Hide and Seek Server

This is the server implementation. Currently it is only setup for one game to run at a time. Will need to split it out to make it able to run multiple at a time.

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`:

```bash
python .\server\main.py
```

## Compute Engine

Activate venv

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

Start server

```bash
python3 server/main.py
```
